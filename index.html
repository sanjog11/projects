                        &emsp; Can you believe this????... 1 year. Aasti Varkhar veteko haina? First of all Happy first of many Anniversary. I know i write letters like these on occasions special to us, and this is very special to me. From not knowing each other to not spending a single day talking, we've come a long way and there's more to come; from our first travel together, first flight together, marriage, first home, first of everything to the last of us.  I know i couldn't give you anything this time tara lekhera rakheko xu la. I just want to thank god for letting you in my life. You are just perfect the way you are. I love all your goods and bads and am proud of having you with me. Although this distance is killing us, you don't let me fell like we are this far from each other. The way you carry yourself, your way of talking, noticing things, talking to people, makes me proud of myself. I love how kind and empathetic you are.

                        &emsp;  I don't love you just because you love me, make me feel special or care for me, i love you for who you are and what this relationship means for us together as a couple. I am not just dating to date but dating to marry and have a future with you. I know we all have faults, tme ma ni xa ma ma ni xa. In spite of all these things, i love how we don't let these things come in our way and try to forgive each other. I don't want to say a lot, it has been a year from kissing, hugging, and carrying you for the first time to knowing that this is for the rest of our lives. I love you and i love our relationship and i promise to do anything for us and make this work. I am proud of everything you are doing and remember i am always with you. I wish we could celebrate this together. I miss you and can't wait to hug you. Take care and stay safe nanu.
